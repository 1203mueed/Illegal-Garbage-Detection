# Illegal Garbage Detection

This repository contains models and scripts for detecting and segmenting garbage in images using state-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation techniques. The primary objective is to address illegal dumping and enhance waste management through AI-driven solutions.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Detectron 2
- Framework: Facebook AI's Detectron2
- Features: Instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN.
- Script: `detectron2.ipynb`
- Note: It is recommended to run Detectron 2 on **Google Colab** for optimal performance and ease of setup.

### 2. Mask R-CNN
- Framework: PyTorch
- Features: Detect and segment garbage in images.
- Script: `maskrcnn_train.py`
- Metrics:
  - `training_metrics.csv` contains detailed logs of training progress.

### 3. YOLO
- Framework: Ultralytics YOLO (v8 and custom modifications).
- Features: Object detection and segmentation.
- Scripts:
  - `yolov11Train.py`: Train YOLOv11 for segmentation.
  - `yolov8Train.py`: Train YOLOv8 for segmentation.
- Results: YOLO achieved the **best results** in the experiments.

## Dataset

The experiment is conducted on a **custom dataset**. The dataset will be published soon to allow others to reproduce the results.

The dataset is organized in COCO format:
- Training images: `train/images`
- Validation images: `val/images`
- Annotations: `coco_training_annotations.json`, `coco_validation_annotations.json`

### Custom Dataset Configuration
Edit the `YOLO/custom.yaml` file to point to the dataset paths:
```yaml
train: /path/to/train
val: /path/to/val
nc: 1
names: ['Garbage']
```

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Mask R-CNN
```bash
python Mask\ R\ Cnn/maskrcnn_train.py
```

### 3. Train YOLOv8
```bash
python YOLO/yolov8Train.py
```

### 4. Train YOLOv11
```bash
python YOLO/yolov11Train.py
```

### 5. Detectron 2
Run the Jupyter notebook `Detectron 2/detectron2.ipynb` to train and test the model. It is recommended to use **Google Colab** for this.

## Results

### YOLO
- Achieved the **best results** among the implemented models.
- Training outputs are stored in `YOLO/runs/segment/`.
- Results:
  - **Train1**: Results for YOLOv11.
    - Best model weights: `YOLO/runs/segment/train1/weights/best.pt`
    - Last model weights: `YOLO/runs/segment/train1/weights/last.pt`
  - **Train2**: Results for YOLOv8.
    - Best model weights: `YOLO/runs/segment/train2/weights/best.pt`
    - Last model weights: `YOLO/runs/segment/train2/weights/last.pt`

### Mask R-CNN
Training metrics are logged in `training_metrics.csv` and `training_metricsold.csv`.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize YOLO models for faster inference on edge devices.
- Experiment with hybrid models combining YOLO and Mask R-CNN.
- Deploy the best model as a real-time API.
